### LetsEatShiba-kun
## About this project
Hi everyone! ðŸ˜¸ 
This is my first Unity 2D project. I created this project to improve my unity programming skill. ðŸ¥°
I like shiba dog so much then I think I want to create a game about shiba. So I come up with the idea about food that dog can eat and cannot.
Finally I create this "Let's Eat Shiba-kun" game! You will play as shiba-kun to go through many stages by collecting food that dog can eat and you should avoid food that dog cannot eat to survive. It will be a food collecting instruction for each stage.

I just upload only the scripts because all of contents is too big ðŸ˜¿ 

## How to play
You can click this link and download it! https://hrtbrxkxr.itch.io/lets-eat-shiba-kun  
Use arrow keys to move backward & forward.  
Use spacebar to jump.  
Collect all of food that in the condition for each stage.  
Try to avoid the food that you can't collect. If you collect it, your heart will be decrease by 1. If you lose all your heart, you will go back to the starting point same as you fall off the platform.
